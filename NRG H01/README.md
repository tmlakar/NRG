## NRG Homework 1: Gaussian splatting

Run the program with:
```bash
$ python gaussian-splatting.py <filename.splat>
```

Note: Make sure the .splat file you want to input is in the same directory!

Note: You will be asked to choose and input a scaling parameter (s) in the terminal after the 1. task (basic transformations and point rendering) is completed and rendered.
